\title{Fuzzy Inference System 1 (FIS1)}
\format{frbs object}
\description{
Fuzzy Inference System used in the Initial Map Matching Process (IMP).
}
\details{
The IMP is the first and very important part
of the map matching process since it is responsible for the identification of the
initial link.
Here you can see the input variables, fuzzy subsets and fuzzy rules used
in FIS1. It is usefull to know the variables and how they affect the rule
outputs in case you plan to change the range of the fuzzy subsets.



Input variables to this FIS are:
\itemize{
  \item speed of the vehicle, v (m/s)
  \item heading error, HE (degrees)
  \item perpendicular distance to candidate link, PD (m)
  \item horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP)
}



The fuzzy subsets of the input variables are:
\itemize{
  \item high, low, zero
  \item small, large
  \item short, long
  \item good, bad
}



The corresponding fuzzy rules used in this FIS are:
\itemize{
\item If ( v is high) and (HE is small) then (L1 is average)
\item If (v is high) and (HE is large) then (L1 is low)
\item If (HDOP is good) and (PD is short) then (L1 is average)
\item If (HDOP is good) and (PD is long) then (L1 is low)
\item If ( HE is small) and (PD is short) then ( L1 is high)
\item If ( HE is large) and ( PD is long) then (L1 is low)
}
